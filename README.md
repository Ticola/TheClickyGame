- The app will render 11 different fruit images to the screen. Each image listens for click events by the user.

- The app keep's track of the user's score, and increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is then reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
